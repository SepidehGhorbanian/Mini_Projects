# Several Mini Projects Regardin Data Science


## Project Intro
In these projects the main purpose is to prepare the data and analyze it, occasionally plot some figures for better understanding and finally, use different features to mine useful information from the data.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization
* Data Analysis

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Project Description
Data analysis is the practice of working with data to glean useful information, which can then be used to make informed decisions.
One of the most important steps is data prepration and preprocessing. Manipulating and finding patterns in the data can have several benefits in order to find new information and enhance performance.

The other important step in data analysis is visualization. Plotting figures and visualizing the data allows you to shape data sets into a more defined narrative, giving you a better context for the information you are viewing.

In these projects several methods have been implemented on diefferent data in order to better understanding and finding relations in the data.
